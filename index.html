  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a Student pursuing B.E. in Information Technology from YCCE, Nagpur. My interests as an engineer
    lies in AI, Robotics and Computer Vision(Image Processing). My project focuses on Image Recognition Software(under-development)
    and I am planning to do projects under Deeplearning and Neural Networks in combination with Image Processing i.e., Computer Vision.
    I'd like to work on What and How Robots SEE and INTERPRET.
    <br>
    Besides the engineering background I would most likely to develop films and
    videos which is enough to prove my interest in Filmmaking and Film Direction. For continuing my interest in filmmaking, I do upload videos on my
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ShreyasNemade">Youtube Channel</a>, where I make videos about my stories and my experiences about
    Self-Development in a cinematic documentation.</p>
